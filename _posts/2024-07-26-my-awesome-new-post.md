# Start writing your blog content here in Markdown...

This is the first paragraph of your post. You can use standard Markdown syntax.

## Subheadings work too

*   And lists
*   Are easy

You can include code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Jekyll!");
```

**After Creating the Post (Either Method):**

1.  **Save the file.**
2.  **(Optional) Preview locally:** If you have Jekyll set up locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and check `http://localhost:4000` to see how it looks.
3.  **Commit and push the changes** to your GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git add _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md
    # Or git add . to add all changes
    git commit -m "Add new blog post: My Awesome New Post"
    git push origin master
    ```

GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site, and your new post should appear shortly.
